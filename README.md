# Text-Processing-Using-Deep-Learning

The goal of the project is to perform a systematic investigation of a number of Deep Learning methods in the context of text processing tasks and benchmark these methods against classical methods where appropriate. This project performs sentiment analysis on the IMDB dataset. It explores different deep learning concepts - different RNN variants, Pre-trained word Embeddings and CNN, and reports the best performing model based on the Accuracy metrics.
